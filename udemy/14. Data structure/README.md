## Data structures

### What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

### Why so many?

Differnt data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while ohters (like arrays) are more generally used.

### Why care?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data struectures
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly
- Interviews

### Case

- Working with map/location data? &#8594; Use a **graph**
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? &#8594; Use a **linked list**
- Web scraping nested HTML? &#8594; Use a **tree**
- Need to write a scheduler? &#8594; Use a **binary heap**
